    <p>In Dunboyne we have a few leisure spots. The main one of these would be the Dunboyne village public park. </p>
    <p>This would be a great walk to bring your dog on so it can have a nice sniff. Also within this park there is a playground with many play areas for the younger kids.
While the little kids are occupied in the playground, the older kids to teenagers can play at the skate park. The skatepark has 7 ramps and a bike rack.
