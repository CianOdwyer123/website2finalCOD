    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Are you looking for a little getaway which has something to suit everyone.  A place that blends the history of the Ancient East, easy access to city shopping and attractions, great locations for golf and horse racing and yet allows you to relax to enjoy the “craic” of a small Irish town?</p>
   
    <p>Then come on down to Dunboyne. We are very proud of our little village, “Dunboyne”. It is set in the southern part of Co Meath, is easy to get to and has loads to offer.</p>
   
    <p>Dunboyne is a lively town with lots to do and see. It is an ideal setting for anyone who wants to explore the ancient history of Meath, while also having easy access to all that Dublin has to offer.</p>
    
    <p>We are just 20 minutes from Dublin Airport, 30 minutes from the centre of Dublin and Dublin Ferry Port and within 15 minutes of the M50 motorway which gives access to all major motorways in Ireland.  There is a regular train service to Dublin and bus services to the city and local towns.</p>
