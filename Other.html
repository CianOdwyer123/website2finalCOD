    <p><br/>Dunboyne is home to many beautiful sites. Some of them are to commemorate some of the biggest events of Irish history in Dunboyne.
Here is just a few:</p>
       
       <li><h2>Dunboyne 1916 Garden of Remembrance:</h2></li>
       <img src="images/garden.jpg" width="600" height="400"><img src="images/plaque.jpg" width="600" height="400">
    <p>This is made to commemorate people from Dunboyne who fought in the 1916. It was also created to mark 100 years since the 1916 rising. It’s a harp printed on the ground and a flag pole in the middle with an Irish flag on it. There is also 7 blocks beside it to represent each member who fought in the 1916 rising. There is a plaque that has the speech printed and engraved on it.</p>
    <li><h2>Dunboyne Castle (The Castle):</h2></li>
       <img src="images/castle.jpg" width="800" height="400">
    <p>On other pages we have talked about Dunboyne Castle Hotel & Spa. But even though this is a hotel now, it was actually a castle until 1996. There is still remains of the castle left untouched that the hotel left out of use.</p>
    <li><h2>Brady’s Pub:</h2></li>
    <img src="images/BradysPub.jpg" width="800" height="400">
    <p>Brady’s Pub is mentioned as the number one pub in Dunboyne. As well as that it is one of the oldest. Back in 1870 when it was built, it wasn’t only just a bar. It was a grocery, a stable and a hotel as well.</p>
    <li><h2>The Riordans:</h2></li>
    <p>This is one to ask your granny about.  The Riordans was a well known rural soap that was created by RTE and ran during the 1960s and '70s.  It was a “must watch” event every Sunday night specially for those with only one TV channel.</p>
    <p>While based in a fictional location of Leestown in Kilkenny, the series was mainly filmed in Dunboyne.  </p>
